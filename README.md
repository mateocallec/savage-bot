## Files

### `index.js`

The main entry point for Savage Bot.
It handles:

* Connecting to Discord with the required intents.
* Counting messages per server and replying automatically when the threshold is reached.
* Handling slash commands like `/trashtalk`, `/addmessage`, `/listmessages`, `/reset`, `/deletemessage`, `/threshold`, `/export`, and `/info`.
* Error handling for permissions and failed message sending.

Key features:

* Replaces `{user}` in messages with the display name of the target user.
* Stores messages and server configuration **locally per server**.
* Allows exporting all server messages and settings via `/export`.

---

### `server storage`

All user-added messages and server configuration are stored **per server** in the `./storage/servers/<guildId>/` folder:

* `messages.json` ‚Äì Stores messages added by server members.
* `config.json` ‚Äì Stores server-specific settings like message threshold, terms URI, and privacy URI.

> All message content is **defined by users**, not preloaded.

```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
THRESHOLD=5
