# Savage Bot

Savage Bot is a Discord bot that replies automatically to messages in a server and allows users to send playful or trash-talk messages via a slash command.

## Files

### `index.js`
This is the main script for Savage Bot.  
It handles:

- Loading configuration (`config.json`) and responses (`messages.json`).
- Connecting to Discord with required intents.
- Counting messages and replying automatically when the threshold is reached.
- Handling the `/trashtalk @username` slash command.
- Error handling for permissions or failed message sending.

Key features:

- Replaces `{user}` in messages with the display name of the target user.
- Fallback to simple message if the bot cannot `reply()`.

---

### `messages.json`
Contains an array of messages that the bot can send.  
Example:

```json
[
  "Hello {user}!",
  "You're unstoppable, {user}!",
  "Watch out, {user}!"
]
````

* `{user}` will be replaced by the target userâ€™s display name.
* You can add, remove, or modify messages freely.

---

### `config.json`

Holds bot configuration:

```json
{
  "threshold": 5,
  "activity": "Watching the chat ðŸ‘€"
}
```

* **threshold**: Number of messages before the bot automatically replies.
* **activity**: Status shown under the botâ€™s presence in Discord.
